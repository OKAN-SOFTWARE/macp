# checkout (where brief.sh lives). VAULT_DIR is where the data lives (logs/,
# Todo/Briefings/, and the plist WorkingDirectory): MACP_VAULT_ROOT (split
# install) or the engine checkout itself (combined layout). The installer is
# run from inside its checkout, so the combined default resolves exactly as the
# old hardcoded fallback did.
# The plist also hands MACP_VAULT_ROOT=$VAULT_DIR to brief.sh (11l), so the
# brief resolves the vault at run time instead of falling back to its own
# checkout. In the combined layout the value equals brief.sh's own ENGINE_DIR,
# so its split-only branch stays off (no-op).
