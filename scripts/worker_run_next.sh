# Vault upkeep entry. Invoked by LaunchAgent every 5 minutes (or manually).
#
# This used to be the v1 executor: `scan-queue` (register auto tasks in
# Worker/queue.json) + `run-next` (execute one). The v2 cutover moved execution
# to the orchestrator + runner daemons (ledger is the SoT, queue.json is a
# derived view), but this script was never switched over — so BOTH executors
# stayed live, each unaware of the other's runs.
#
# The result was that every auto task ran TWICE. Mostly that only wasted quota,
# because the v2 stages detect the collision ("blocked on duplicate dispatch")
# and bail. On 2026-08-14 it did real damage: leaf 16 and leaf 17 were each
# double-run against the single ~/Worker/ai-stock-trading clone, and the four
# concurrent pipelines' branch-preps reset leaf 17's finished implementation off
# its branch and `git clean -fd`'d leaf 16's long_job artifact.
#
# `maintenance` is the post-cutover subcommand built for exactly this slot: vault
# upkeep only (stale review autoclose + remote-run sweep), no dispatch, no
# execution. Planning is NOT lost — the planner has its own LaunchAgent
# (<prefix>secondbrain.planner -> scripts/planner_tick.sh, every 30m).

# Two anchors, as in orchestrator_tick.sh (11g). ENGINE_DIR is this script's
# own checkout (the todo_system package). VAULT_DIR is where the data lives
# (logs/, and the cwd todo_system.worker resolves its vault from):
# MACP_VAULT_ROOT (split install) or the engine checkout itself (combined
# layout). The LaunchAgent runs this script from inside its checkout, so the
# combined default resolves exactly as the old hardcoded fallback did.
# Unlike brief.sh / orchestrator_tick.sh this script never read
# MAESTRO_VAULT_DIR, and still does not.

# todo_system is not installed (package = false), so the import comes from
# the cwd, which stays the vault. `uv run --project` picks the engine venv
# without moving it; a split install also puts the engine on PYTHONPATH and
# runs python -P so a stale copy in the vault cannot shadow it. The
# combined layout leaves env and argv alone.
#
# Installed wheel (public split 13b): ENGINE_DIR is site-packages/todo_system/
# _engine — no pyproject.toml for `uv run --project`, not a package for
# PYTHONPATH. engine_script hands the caller's interpreter down as MACP_PYTHON
# and the module runs under it with -P; uv is not needed at all, so the uv
# guard below is skipped. Only when BOTH hold — no pyproject AND MACP_PYTHON
# set; a checkout (pyproject present) keeps the uv command line byte for byte.
# A bare path run of the wheel with no MACP_VAULT_ROOT would resolve the vault
# to site-packages; the units that pass the env are leaf 13c's.
