# CUTOVER tick — v2 owns execution. Dispatch open auto tasks to agents (the
# worker-default runner executes the staged pipeline), collect replies, re-nudge
# humans, regenerate the dashboard. Activate by copying this over
# orchestrator_tick.sh (see scripts/CUTOVER.md). Rollback: git restore
# scripts/orchestrator_tick.sh + re-bootstrap the legacy worker.

# Two anchors, same as brief.sh. ENGINE_DIR is this script's own checkout (the
# todo_system package). VAULT_DIR is where the data lives (Worker/, Todo/,
# logs/): MAESTRO_VAULT_DIR wins, then MACP_VAULT_ROOT (split install, engine
# checkout != vault), then the engine checkout itself (combined layout:
# unchanged behaviour).

# The orchestrator resolves its defaults (ledger, registry, dashboard paths,
# hq-host marker, the git pull) against its cwd, so the cwd stays the vault and
# `uv run --project` picks the engine without moving it. todo_system is not
# installed (package = false): a split install puts the engine on PYTHONPATH
# and runs python -P so a stale copy in the vault cannot shadow it. The
# combined layout leaves the env alone.
#
# Installed wheel (public split 13b): ENGINE_DIR is site-packages/todo_system/
# _engine, which ships no pyproject.toml (so `uv run --project` cannot work) and
# is not a package (so PYTHONPATH must not point at it). engine_script hands the
# caller's interpreter down as MACP_PYTHON; its site-packages already holds
# todo_system, so the module runs under that interpreter with -P (a stale copy
# in the vault cwd cannot shadow it). Taken only when BOTH hold — no pyproject
# AND MACP_PYTHON set — so a checkout (pyproject present) and a bare path run
# (MACP_PYTHON unset) keep the uv command line below byte for byte. A bare path
# run of the wheel with no MACP_VAULT_ROOT would resolve the vault to
# site-packages; the units that pass the env are leaf 13c's.
