"""Stale human-owned tasks — surface work that nothing else is chasing.

The orchestrator nudges its own parked assignments (`renudge_due`), but that
only reaches tasks which already have a ledger entry. A task a human owns and
never dispatched has no ledger entry at all, so nothing ever pings it: no
`due`, no `not_before`, no assignment, no nudge — it just ages out of sight.
This module finds exactly those and hands them to the dashboard renderer, which
is what the daily brief reads.

Notify-only by construction (acceptance criterion): the connection is opened
`mode=ro`, and this module issues nothing but SELECT. Nothing auto-fills `due`
— a missing deadline is usually deliberate, and inventing one would drown the
brief's real deadline warnings in noise.

Both knobs live here and nowhere else:

`STALE_DAYS = 7` — measured 2026-08-18 against `Todo/todo.db`: 29 open leaves,
21 of them undated, 9 of those human-owned and not deferred. Those 9
candidates' idle ages were `[2, 9, 12, 25, 25, 26, 26, 29, 68]` — nothing at
all lands in 3..8 days, so every threshold from 3 to 9 selects the same 8
tasks. 7 sits mid-plateau, so it can drift +-4 days without changing what gets
surfaced. It also matches the `review_cycle: weekly` cadence CLAUDE.md's task
template prescribes (7 of those 29 open leaves carry that value), and it
catches the 8-day-idle keystore task that motivated the sweep.

`MAX_SURFACED = 5` — noise is bounded by the cap, not by the threshold, which
is exactly why STALE_DAYS can afford to be generous. The truncated count is
always printed so a capped list can never be misread as a complete one.

    `today` (ISO date) alone means 00:00 that day for the `not_before` clock;
    `now` pins it exactly. Neither = host-local now.

    Excluded on purpose:

    - anything with a `due` — the brief's deadline sections already carry it;
    - anything with a future `not_before` — deferring a task IS attending to
      it, and re-surfacing it would punish the user for planning ahead. Same
      semantics as the dispatch gates in `worker.py` / `tasks.py`, via the
      shared `not_before.is_deferred` (date-only = 00:00 that day, a time
      honored host-local);
    - worker-owned tasks, via `ownership.human_owned_sql_filter()` reused
      rather than reimplemented, so this agrees with NOW/FOCUS and the
      calendar. That is what drops the `blocked` cluster the pipeline is
