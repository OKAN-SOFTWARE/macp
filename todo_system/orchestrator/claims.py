"""Crash-durable claims — "the execution of this envelope STARTED".

`Runner.poll_once()` used to ack only *after* `handle()` returned. `finally`
covers an exception; it does not cover SIGKILL, a reboot, or the daemon
restarting the runner. So a pipeline that died mid-flight left its envelope
un-acked, `Mailbox.receive()` (whose only redelivery gate is the cursor's `seen`
set) handed the very same envelope back on the next idle poll, and the worker
re-ran all five stages from scratch — on a task that may already have committed,
pushed and merged a PR.

A claim is the fact that survives the process: written to disk *before*
`handle()` is called, removed only after the envelope is acked. On redelivery
the runner finds the claim and classifies instead of re-running.

Layout mirrors the mailbox's own local state, so it inherits `.gitignore`'s
`Worker/agents/_state/` (never the git-synced `inbox/` transport) and a test's
tempdir root for free:

    <mailbox.root>/_state/<agent_id>/claims/<msg_id>.json

One file per envelope, not one shared `inflight.json`: a single file needs an
atomic rewrite, and one truncated write would take out the defence for *every*
envelope at once — precisely how `cursor.json` fails today (`_load_seen` swallows
`JSONDecodeError` and returns an empty set, redelivering everything). Per-file,
the blast radius of corruption is one envelope.

`read()` returning None means "no claim", so a corrupt claim degrades to today's
behaviour (keep redelivering) rather than to silence.

Stdlib-only, like the rest of the transport: this must run on a bare-python3
remote host with no PyYAML.
