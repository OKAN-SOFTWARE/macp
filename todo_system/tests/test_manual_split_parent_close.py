"""reconcile_split_parents: a parent a human split BY HAND into children (no
`auto_rescoped`, no `is_parent`) is auto-closed once every child is done, and its
parked ledger row is tidied from AWAITING_HUMAN/FAILED to DONE — so renudge_due
stops nudging it. An ordinary project umbrella (no oversize-rescope park) is still
only surfaced, never auto-closed.

Reproduces the `dancemirror-unified-projects` situation (2026-10-10~11) but with
NEUTRAL identifiers only: the parent md omits `repo` / uses a placeholder, because
the real DanceMirror URL contains a personal token the public-identifier gate
forbids. The auto-close signal is the ledger `blocked_on` text + child status, not
the repo URL, so neutral fixtures lose nothing.

Uses a real tmp vault + todo.db (import-md) + Ledger because the rollup reads the
DB (parent_slug / child status) and the close touches the markdown. The `cli`
globals are rebound to the tmp vault on top of the package conftest's runtime-path
isolation so nothing touches the live vault.
