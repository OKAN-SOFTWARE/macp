"""Public-split gates run against *this repo's real tree*, not a fixture.

``test_check_public_identifiers.py`` pins the gate *logic* on throwaway repos
via the ``AUDIT_*`` env seams. That never looks at the code a PR actually
ships, and the gates themselves only ran when a public-split leaf named them in
its acceptance criteria — vault-task Verify runs just ruff + pytest. PR #201
merged a hard-coded GitHub owner URL into ``orchestrator/beta_publish.py``
through exactly that gap. These tests put the gates on the standard pytest
path, so any worker PR that plants a personal identifier in the engine tree
fails ``pytest -q`` with the offending file named in the assertion output:

* ratchet (``scripts/check_public_identifiers.sh``) — no file may gain hits
  over ``scripts/public_identifiers_baseline.txt``.
* export (``... --export``) — the public export set must stay at zero.
* engine isolation (``scripts/check_engine_isolation.sh``) — the engine tree
  archived alone still runs against a throwaway vault, with ``UV_OFFLINE=1``
  so it can never reach the network. Measured 2026-10-08 on the HQ host, warm uv
  cache: PASS in 6.31s and 3.00s (limit for inclusion was 60s offline). The
  script archives committed HEAD and builds a fresh ``.venv`` in a ``mktemp``
  dir from the uv cache for its four ``uv run`` calls — a host with a cold
  cache fails here offline rather than hanging.

No literal from the identifier gate's ``PATTERN`` may appear in this file: it
sits inside the scanned tree and is *not* on the script's self-exclude list,
so the gate checks this file too.
